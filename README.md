# Cement Strength Predictor - Flutter App

## 📌 Overview
Cement Strength Predictor is a **Flutter-based mobile application** that utilizes **machine learning** to predict the **compressive strength** of cement based on various input parameters. This app helps civil engineers, researchers, and construction professionals make data-driven decisions about cement quality.

## 🎯 Features
- 🏗 **User-friendly UI** for inputting cement composition data
- 🔍 **Real-time predictions** using a trained machine learning model


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🎨 **Flutter** (Frontend)
- 🔹 **Dart** (Programming language)


## 📥 Installation
### Prerequisites
- 📌 Flutter SDK installed → [Get Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- 📌 Dart installed
- 📌 Android Studio or Visual Studio Code (for development)

### Steps to Run
```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cement_strength_predictor.git
cd cement_strength_predictor

# 2️⃣ Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3️⃣ Run the app on an emulator or a real device
flutter run
```

## 📊 Model Details
The cement strength prediction model is trained on data containing:
- 🏗 **Cement composition** *(e.g., Cement, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, etc.)*
- ⏳ **Curing age** *(in days)*
- 🌍 **Environmental factors** *(optional)*



## 📌 How to Use
1️⃣ **Enter cement composition values**  
2️⃣ **Click on the 'Predict' button**  
3️⃣ **View the predicted compressive strength**  
4️⃣ *(Optional)* **Save predictions for later analysis**

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- 🎯 Implement a **more advanced ML model** for better accuracy
- 📊 Add **historical data visualization**

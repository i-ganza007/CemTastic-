Cement Strength Predictor - Flutter App

📌 Overview

Cement Strength Predictor is a Flutter-based mobile application that utilizes machine learning to predict the compressive strength of cement based on various input parameters. This app helps civil engineers, researchers, and construction professionals make data-driven decisions about cement quality.

🎯 Features

User-friendly UI for inputting cement composition data

Real-time predictions using a trained machine learning model

🛠️ Tech Stack

Flutter (Frontend)

Dart (Programming language)


📥 Installation

Prerequisites

Flutter SDK installed (Get Flutter)

Dart installed

Android Studio or Visual Studio Code (for development)

Steps to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cement_strength_predictor.git
cd cement_strength_predictor

Install dependencies:

flutter pub get

Run the app on an emulator or a real device:

flutter run

📊 Model Details

The cement strength prediction model is trained on data containing:

Cement composition (e.g., Cement, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, etc.)

Curing age (in days)

Environmental factors (optional)

🚀 Future Improvements

Implement a more advanced ML model for better accuracy

Add historical data visualization

Support multiple prediction models for comparison

Integrate with cloud storage (Firebase)
